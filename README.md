## Overview

With the TeamLink app, you get a space in Microsoft Teams where your team (or even the whole organisation) can share their whereabouts for the coming weeks, months or further (if they're that organised!).  Whether it's working from home, one of your offices or not working e.g. vacations, not working or other planned leave, they can share this with a click of a button.

Users can choose which team members they 'follow' with their location shared in an easy to view grid, or they can view by office or site to see all users who are planning to be working there. You can even quickly send a message in Microsoft Teams to arrange a meet up by clicking the coffee icon.

TeamLink is a Teams application built on the [Dataverse for Teams](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/reshape-the-future-of-work-with-microsoft-dataverse-for-teams-now-generally-available/) on the Power Platform. Once installed, it can be [customized and extended](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/teams/customize-sample-apps) by the installer of the application.

## Installing

Detailed documentation for installation can be found in the [Documents](https://github.com/stuartridout/teamlink/tree/main/Documentation) folder to install the app as an unmanaged solution. 

**Import the solution as unmanaged:**

This option is for advanced makers already familiar with solutions and environments concepts in Dataverse. You can import the solution into Dataverse for Teams or Dataverse as unmanaged. By doing so, you get an unmanaged solution and will be able to make changes to all components of the application -- including underlying tables. Note that you will not be able to take advantage of future upgrades when importing solution as unmanaged.
