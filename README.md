## Overview

With the Boards app, you and your team can create boards about anything — interests, initiatives, onboarding, etc. You can also post just about anything to a board—images, articles, websites, and even direct links to teams, channels, and specific discussion threads within Microsoft Teams. This flexibility makes sharing ideas and content discovery efficient and seamless. Refer [here](https://aka.ms/TeamsBoardsDocs) for more detailed view of the feature.

Boards is a template application built on the [Datatverse for Teams](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/reshape-the-future-of-work-with-microsoft-dataverse-for-teams-now-generally-available/) on the Power Platform. Once installed, it can be [customized and extended](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/teams/customize-sample-apps) by the installer of the application.

## Installing

Detailed documentation for installation can be found in the [Documents](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-boards/tree/main/Documentation) folder. There are two ways to install the solution:

**_Recommended_: Install in Teams**

**This is the easiest and quickest method to get started with this app template.** The provisioning is fully automated once the process starts and may take upto 2 - 3 minutes. You will get the option to chose which Teams team you'd like to install this application in. Refer to these [easy step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-boards/blob/main/Documentation/Boards%20-%20Install%20in%20Teams/Boards%20-%20Install%20in%20Teams.md) on how to get started with Perspectives app.

If this is the first Power Apps in the team, a new Dataverse for Teams environment will be provisioned, the app installed, automatically shared with all members of the team and tabbed to the channel you had picked in the first step. You will be able to [edit the app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/teams/customize-sample-apps) after installation by going to the Power Apps app.

Note that this provisions the 'managed' solution in the Teams environment. This means that you can take advantage of any future updates being made to the application by reinstalling the application (follow same steps as original installation).

**Import the solution as unmanaged:**

This option is for advanced makers already familiar with solutions and environments concepts in Dataverse. You can import the solution into Dataverse for Teams or Dataverse as unmanaged. By doing so, you get an unmanaged solution and will be able to make changes to all components of the application -- including underlying tables. Note that you will not be able to take advantage of future upgrades when importing solution as unmanaged.
