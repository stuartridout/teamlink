   Note: Once installed, you can change the location of tabs within the team. You can also share the app with members in your organization outside the specific Teams team. It is best to select the Teams team where whose members include people who are likely to extend the app or administer the app.


1. Click on Save to start the installation process.

   Note: The installation may take up to 2 – 3 minutes to complete. During the installation, you are getting a local copy of the database and the applications. The finished application is functional out of the box, but since you have the local copy and full access to source code, you can customize or extend the experience using Power Platform’s low-code development framework.

   During installation, you will see the following screen. You can continue your work within Teams while the installation is being completed. Once complete, you will get an activity feed notification and an email notifying the completion of the installation process.

   In either of these cases, you can validate if the app installed correctly by going to Power Apps personal
   app, and checking for the presence of the app in “Installed Apps” section of the specific Teams team.

   If you cannot locate the app here, you should retry installing.
   If you can locate the app here, you have successfully installed the app and need to re-add the tab using the instructions below.

   Go to the Teams team channel where you want to add the tab. Click on “+” icon on top to add a tab.

   Search for and launch the “Power Apps” app.

   The Power Apps will give options for all apps that can be tabbed. Look for the app you recently installed by searching for ‘Boards’.
   You may see multiple versions of the app if you have installed it in multiple teams. Select the team inwhich you are pinning this app (in this example, the Boards app from “Test Team_05_19”) and click “Save”.
